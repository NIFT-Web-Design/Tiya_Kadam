				<h2 class="second-section-heading">Flexibility with Timing, Budget, and Location</h2>
				<p class="second-para-text">We have a number of consultants available on a full-time basis, however, we know that full-time consultants aren’t always the right choice for an organization’s project or budget. That’s why we always strive to be flexible and accommodating. Below are a few of the ways that we can meet your specific needs.</p>

				<div class="row pt-40">
					<div class="col-md-4">
						<div class="boxi text-center">
							<h2>part-time consultants</h2>
							<p>Not all positions need to be full-time. You may find that you need someone with a highly specific skill set to work on a project only part-time. We can always find the right consultants to fit your specific requirements.</p>
						</div>
					</div>
					<div class="col-md-4">
						<div class="boxi text-center">
							<h2>advice on retainer</h2>
							<p>At times you just need a little impartial advice here and there, without the investment in a full-time consultant. We can put you in contact with the right person to answer your questions on an as-needed basis.</p>
						</div>
					</div>
					<div class="col-md-4">
						<div class="boxi text-center">
							<h2>remote consultants</h2>
							<p>When you need the job done right but don’t require a person in the office, we can find the right consultant at a lower cost if they work remotely.</p>
						</div>
					</div>
				</div>

				<div class="row pt-20">
					<div class="col-md-4">
						<div class="boxi text-center">
							<h2>short-term contracts</h2>
							<p>Not every placement needs to be a 2 year contract. We recognize that many projects will require short-term work, and we are more than willing to collaborate with you to ensure the most flexible arrangement to fit your institution’s specific needs.</p>
						</div>
					</div>
					<div class="col-md-4">
						<div class="boxi text-center">
							<h2>cost-flexible solutions</h2>
							<p>Whether you’d like to commit to an hourly contract or fixed-fee pricing, we offer a variety of options that allow you to meet your budget requirements. For example, in some cases, a junior consultant may be exactly what you need.</p>
						</div>
					</div>
					<div class="col-md-4">
						<div class="boxi text-center">
							<h2>custom project solutions</h2>
							<p>If you don’t see one solution that works for you, we are more than happy to work to fit your needs and create a fair arrangement that works for you—whether that means modifying an existing service, combining services, or having a consultant work on a trial-basis.</p>
